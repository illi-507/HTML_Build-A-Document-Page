                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
                    <br>Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                    <br> environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
                    <br>elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
                    <br>of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                        <br>Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        <br> elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                        <br>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
                        <br>For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity 
                        <br>of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li> 
                </ul>
                    <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                        <br> For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
                        <br>mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.

                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                    <br>The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript 
                    <br>follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was 
                    <br>renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a
                    <br>small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model 
                    <br>instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what 
                    <br>is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
                    <br>Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                    <br><br>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. 
                    <br>You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to 
                    <br>implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <br>With the keyword var. For example,<br>
                <br>
                <pre class="pre">
                    <code>
                        var x = 42.
                    </code>
                </pre>    
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>   
                <pre class="pre">
                    <code>
                        x = 42.
                    </code>
                </pre>   
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                <pre class="pre">
                    <code>
                        let y = 13.
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
            <header><h1>Variable Scope</h1></header>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other
                    <br>code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
                    <br>only within that function.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local
                    <br> to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the 
                    <br>scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p>
                    <pre class="pre">
                        <code>
                            if (true) {
                                var x = 5;
                                }
                                console.log(x);  // 5
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015</p>
                    <pre class="pre">
                        <code>
                            if (true) {
                                let y = 5;
                                }
                                console.log(y);

                <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. 
                    <br>An if statement looks as follows:</p>
                    <pre class="pre">
                        <code>
                            if (condition) {
                                statement_1;
                                } else {
                                    statement_2;
                                    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. 
                    <br>If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, 
                    <br>including further nested if statements.
                    <br>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <pre class="pre">
                    <code>
                    if (condition_1) {
                        } else if (condition_2) {
                            statement_2;
                        } else if (condition_n) {
                            statement_n;
                        } else {
                            statement_last;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group 
                    <br>them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
                <pre class="pre">
                    <code>
                        if (condition) {
                            statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                            } else {
                                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                                }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code.
                    <br>For example, do not use the following code:</p>
                <pre class="pre">
                    <code>
                        if (x = y) {
                            /* statements here */
                            }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
                <pre class="pre">
                    <code>
                        if ((x = y)) {
                            /* statements here */
                            }
                    </code>
